# CS2-Uninstaller
A simple script to remove CS2 from your CS:GO Legacy game.

It is for people who don't want to waste space for CS2 when all you want is CS:GO
## How does it help?

CS2 takes up a whole 47GB on your system. With CS:GO Legacy installed, it becomes over 70GB!!!

What this tool does is it simply removes all the CS2 files so you're just left with the 30GB for CS:GO.

## Installation

Download the Powershell script if you are on Windows.

If you are on MacOS or Linux, use the Bash script.

## Usage

### Windows
Right click on the script, and choose "Run with PowerShell"

Once it closes, open your game and select "Play Legacy Version of CS:GO" and click "Always use this option" if you don't plan on using CS2 ever again.

### Linux
Open a terminal and run `sudo ./cs2-uninstall.sh`
